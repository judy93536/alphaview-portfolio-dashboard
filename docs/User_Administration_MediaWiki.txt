= AlphaView Portfolio Dashboard - User Administration =

== Overview ==

This guide explains how to add and manage users for the AlphaView Portfolio Dashboard using AWS Cognito. The system supports two user roles: '''Admin''' (full access) and '''Viewer''' (read-only access).

=== Dashboard Access ===
* '''Production URL''': http://35.80.141.177:8051
* '''Authentication''': AWS Cognito User Pool
* '''User Pool ID''': us-west-2_BzA3NZOv6

== User Roles ==

=== Admin Group ===
{{Icon|crown}} '''Full Dashboard Access'''
* All tabs including Execute Trades and Update Prices
* Can buy/sell stocks and execute portfolio trades
* Can update portfolio values with latest market prices
* All viewer permissions plus administrative functions

=== Viewer Group ===
{{Icon|eye}} '''Read-Only Access'''
* Target vs Actual, Performance, Transaction Log, Portfolio Export
* Full performance analytics and reporting capabilities
* Can generate and download portfolio reports
* Cannot execute trades or update prices

== Adding New Users ==

=== Step 1: Access AWS Cognito Console ===

# Log into AWS Console
# Navigate to '''Cognito''' → '''User pools'''
# Select your user pool: '''User pool - kryhxh'''

=== Step 2: Create New User ===

# Click '''Users''' tab
# Click '''Create user''' button
# Fill in user details:
#* '''Email address''': Enter real email address (e.g., <code>john.doe@company.com</code>)
#* '''Mark email as verified''': {{Checkbox|checked}} '''REQUIRED - Check this box'''
#* '''Send an invitation''': {{Checkbox|checked}} Check this (sends login instructions via email)
#* '''Temporary password''': 
#** Recommended: Let AWS generate one
#** Alternative: Set custom temporary password
#* '''User must create a new password at next sign-in''': {{Checkbox|checked}} Check this

=== Step 3: Assign User to Group ===

# After creating the user, click on the user's email in the user list
# Go to '''Group memberships''' tab
# Click '''Add user to group'''
# Select appropriate group:
#* '''<code>admin</code>''' - For users who need trading capabilities
#* '''<code>viewer</code>''' - For users who only need read-only access

== User Invitation Process ==

=== What Happens When You Create a User ===

'''Email Sent''': User receives an invitation email with:
* Username (their email address)
* Temporary password
* Login URL: http://35.80.141.177:8051
* Instructions for first login

'''First Login Process''':
# User visits the dashboard URL
# Enters email + temporary password
# System prompts for new permanent password
# User creates secure password
# Automatically redirected to dashboard based on role

== Security Best Practices ==

=== User Management ===
{{Checklist|
* Always mark email addresses as verified when creating users
* Use strong temporary passwords or let AWS generate them
* Require users to create new passwords on first login
* Assign users to appropriate groups based on job function
* Regularly review user access and remove inactive accounts
}}

=== Email Verification ===
{{Important|Always check "Mark email as verified"}}
* '''Reason''': Prevents authentication issues and ensures proper email delivery
* '''Impact''': Unverified emails cannot receive password reset notifications

=== Group Assignment ===
* '''Required''': Every user must be assigned to either <code>admin</code> or <code>viewer</code> group
* '''No Group''': Users without group assignment cannot access the dashboard
* '''Multiple Groups''': Not recommended - assign to one primary group

== Troubleshooting ==

=== User Cannot Login ===
# '''Check email verification''': Ensure email is marked as verified in Cognito
# '''Check group membership''': User must be in <code>admin</code> or <code>viewer</code> group
# '''Check user status''': Ensure user is not disabled
# '''Password issues''': Reset password if user forgot new password

=== User Gets "Access Denied" ===
# '''Wrong group''': Viewer trying to access admin-only features
# '''No group''': User not assigned to any group
# '''Session expired''': User needs to logout and login again

=== Email Not Received ===
# '''Check spam folder''': Cognito emails may go to spam
# '''Email verification''': Ensure email is marked as verified
# '''Resend invitation''': Create new temporary password and resend

== Technical Details ==

=== Authentication Flow ===
# User enters credentials at login page
# AWS Cognito validates credentials
# System checks user's group membership
# Dashboard loads with appropriate tabs based on role
# All API calls are authenticated with Cognito session tokens

=== Session Management ===
* '''Session Duration''': Configured in Cognito settings
* '''Logout''': Clears local session and redirects to login
* '''Auto-logout''': Sessions expire based on Cognito configuration

=== Database Access ===
* '''Portfolio Data''': AWS RDS PostgreSQL (users see real portfolio data)
* '''Price Data''': Daily S&P 500 universe from 2022-01-03 to present
* '''Calculations''': Real-time portfolio metrics and performance analytics
