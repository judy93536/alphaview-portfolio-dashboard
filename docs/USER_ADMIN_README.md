## Security Best Practices

### User Management
- ‚úÖ Always mark email addresses as verified when creating users
- ‚úÖ Use strong temporary passwords or let AWS generate them
- ‚úÖ Require users to create new passwords on first login
- ‚úÖ Assign users to appropriate groups based on job function
- ‚úÖ Regularly review user access and remove inactive accounts

### Email Verification
- **Critical**: Always check "Mark email as verified" 
- **Reason**: Prevents authentication issues and ensures proper email delivery
- **Impact**: Unverified emails cannot receive password reset notifications

### Group Assignment
- **Required**: Every user must be assigned to either `admin` or `viewer` group
- **No Group**: Users without group assignment cannot access the dashboard
- **Multiple Groups**: Not recommended - assign to one primary group

## Troubleshooting

### User Cannot Login
1. **Check email verification**: Ensure email is marked as verified in Cognito
2. **Check group membership**: User must be in `admin` or `viewer` group
3. **Check user status**: Ensure user is not disabled
4. **Password issues**: Reset password if user forgot new password

### User Gets "Access Denied"
1. **Wrong group**: Viewer trying to access admin-only features
2. **No group**: User not assigned to any group
3. **Session expired**: User needs to logout and login again

### Email Not Received
1. **Check spam folder**: Cognito emails may go to spam
2. **Email verification**: Ensure email is marked as verified
3. **Resend invitation**: Create new temporary password and resend

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials at login page
2. AWS Cognito validates credentials
3. System checks user's group membership
4. Dashboard loads with appropriate tabs based on role
5. All API calls are authenticated with Cognito session tokens

### Session Management
